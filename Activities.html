							<h2>Global Leadership Summit</h2>
							<p>I got the chance to participate in GLS in Klaipėda in 2016 as a volunteer. The experience 
							of being one of the staff and meeting other inspiring people was great. I'd definitely recommend volunteering 
							at least once - you won't regret it.</p>

							<h2>Lithuanian Culture and Language courses</h2>
							<p>In the summer of 2017, I was one of the leaders of Lithuanian Culture and Language courses in Klaipėda.
							The participants flew over to Klaipėda from Uzbekistan, U.S.A, Madagascar, Hungary, Belarus and even more
							just to learn Lithuanian and see the country! I cannot describe how wonderful the people were and it's great to
							have friends even in Uzbekistan.

							<h2>Cultural Multi Awareness Program</h2>
							<p>In 2018, I was one of the leaders of CMAP - a program dedicated to teach Klaipėda students about 
							various cultures, introduce them to non-Lithuanians and insipire tolerance towards other cultures.
							I loved communicating with the youth of Klaipėda and I even got to present globalization and issues in fashion to them.
